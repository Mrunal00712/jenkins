 Master-slave architecture with Docker

Slave-Agent:
  - we will equire the docker setup on the slave environment
  - we have to build the os using such docker image which contains, 1. Git Install
                                                                    2. Maven Install
                                                                    3. SSH enabled ==  //ssh running continously
                                                                    4. User name == jenkins // to loinn as #ssh -l jenkins IP
                                                                    5. Password == jenkins
 - Image == vimal13/jenkins-slave-maven
 - Docker is container is isolated they are connecting throw host only to coonect with jenkins master we have change some setting
   # systemctl status docker
   # vim /usr/lib/system/docker.service
   we have allow the connection
       ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd   -H tcp://0.0.0.0:4243  -H fd://...
   # systemctl daemon-reload
   # systemctl restart docker

 - before doing anything first we will check the connectivity with docker system
   Go to jenkins master base system # curl  (slaveIP):4243  //aws firwalld inbound rule (TCP) &&&& port no: 4243     
                                    # curl slaveIP:4243/version   //if the page is displayed then it is having the connecivity

 - now we have to configure the Jenkin master where is the my Docker platform (Integerating Jenkins with docker)
     Here jenkins is integrating wih docker we have to install some plugins related to docker 
     plugin-->available-->Docker=install
  Manage Jenkins --> System Configuration --> Cloud -->Configure Clouds--Add a new Cloud --> Docker -->
              --> name : docker 
                  Docker cloud Details : Docker Host URL : tcp://(slaveIP):4243 ==> Test connection--> Tick =Enabled, Expose Docker_HOST  //I have told jenkins where my system is

                                                 Docker Image: vimal13/jenkins-slave-maven
                                                 Container Setting:

                                                                        ADD:-> User name : jenkins

                                                                        Select=> jenkins/*********
