If we want to automate thisngs fully the it is not possible bya any automation tools, itis coming from culture "Silos"

to automate the things we have to write the code - here we have to write in a Groovy language

Groovy Language -> 1. Scripted
                   2. Declearative (here we are useing this)
                      - in declearative you just need to decleare you don't need to know internal commandes.
                      - ex., you need to install some software then we use "yum install software name)
                              in this you just have to decleare "# i want to install pacakage : dialog ", no need to know the yum internal command

plan :-> Job1     -> Job2     ->  Job3 
        Stage1      stage2       stage3
         SCM        Deploy        Test
         pull

Code:
