Master-slave Architecture

Build tool for Java = Ant, Gradle, Maven-- for different language has different
Build means comple and test and build package

** Distrubuted Scheduling 
    Master node is distrubuting the job to different- differnt slaves this concept is known as Distributed scheduling
    in Kubernetes same kind of architecture we known as distrubuted container , in hadoop distrubuted storage 

On Demand
  means code come from GitHub, Jenkins will set the environment, jenkin will perform the task in environment and Jenkin will delete the environment 

Agent Pogram
    From one computer to other computer you are sending the information/instruction you need some program runing there that 
    program has should have capability to take the instruction from master accordingly they perform, that program typically known as agent program
    we have to install Aent program on both the slave node 
      Agent program 1 thing = connect with master
                    2 thing = follow the master instruction 

Jenkins Master --> Dashboard --> Nodes --> Built in Node (the jenkins controller's built-in node)
--> new node --> to add
Create new note == Linux slave -> permanent
             - Launch method = Launch agents via SSH 
                - HOST = give the slave public IP 
                - Credential = Jenkins(internal provided to you )
                        Kind = SSH Username with private key 
                            Username = ec2-user
                            private key = enter directly ->  add --> copy private key and add
            - Remote root directory = create a folde in diectory (name= jenkinsws) go to that folder and find path -- pwd ==/home/ec2-user/jenkinsws
            - Labels = every node you have to give unique name , ex., linuxbuildnode
            - Availability : Keep this agent online as much as possible 
            - Host Key Verification Strategy = Non verifying Verification Strategy
    Jenkins is sending agent to the slave system but this agent is written in the program java, we need java in slave system , min req JDK 11
       same version as mastr you have to install java     
            - Save 
    Launch Agent
To run the job in slave , New Item -> create job -> General -> Restrict where this project-can be run -> Label expression = add label
